<center><h1>Mediasoup Overview</h1></center>
<h3>I.Components:</h3>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1. <u><strong>Client</strong></u>  </br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe client-side application in the Media medium.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2. <u><strong>Server</strong></u>  </br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe server-side serving media data.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3. <u><strong>Router</strong></u>  </br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Router is used to inject, select, and forward media streams created through Transport instances.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp4. <u><strong>Signal</strong></u>  </br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp-A signaling protocol is a type of communications protocol for encapsulating the signaling between communication endpoints and switching systems to establish or tear down a connection, and to identify the state of connection.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- <span style="color:red">Mediasoup does not provide any network signaling protocol to communicate with endpoints/browsers</span>. It just handles the media layer and provides a JavaScript API to set the media parameters.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp5. <u><strong>Peer</strong></u>  </br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- v2 includes the concept of “peers” in its API. A Peer represents a participant in the conference, thus it has a local (client side) representation and a remote (server side) representation. When a client joins a Room it also gets information about existing and new Peers in the conference.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- A peer is just a container that holds transports, producers and consumers (in fact, a peer just exists in the mediasoup JavaScript land).</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- v3 gets rid of “peers” and enforces a low level API based on transports that hold producers and consumers. It's up to the application to handle “peers” at signaling level (if needed) and associate mediasoup entities with those “peers”.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp6. <u><strong>Data Channel</strong></u>  </br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- A data channel is a computer path used when transferring data from one device to another.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Mediasoup implements WebRTC DataChannels, this is: SCTP streams on top of DTLS on top of UDP/TCP.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Mediasoup also implements pure SCTP protocol on top of plain UDP (for PlainRtpTransport and PipeTransport). This makes it possible to interact with SCTP messages (in and out) in server side.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp7. <u><strong>Worker</strong></u>  </br> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA Worker represents a mediasoup C++ sub-process that runs on a single-core CPU and processes Router instances</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp8. <u><strong>Transport</strong></u>  </br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTransport connects the terminal with the MediaSoup Router, and implements two-way media transmission through the Producer and Consumer instances created on it. The following three types of Transport are realized: WebRtcTransport, PlainRtpTransport, and PipeTransport.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp9. <u><strong>Producer</strong></u>  </br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne producer represents a being injected into MediaSoupRouterAudio or video source. It is defining how media data packets are transmitted.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp10. <u><strong>Consumer</strong></u>  </br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne consumer Represents a MediaSoupRouterAudio or video source forwarded to the terminal. It is defining how media data packets are transmitted.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp11. <u><strong>Room</strong></u>  </br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA Room represents a multi-party conference with N participants (Peers). Within a Room, audio and video tracks generated by a client/browser are relayed to all the participants.</br>
<h3>II.Comunication:</h3>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMediasoup does not provide any signaling protocol to communicate clients and server. It's up to the application communicate them by using WebSocket, HTTP or whichever communication means, and exchange mediasoup related parameters, requests/responses and notifications between clients and server. In most scenarios this communication must be bidirectional so a full-duplex channel is usually required. However the application can reuse the same channel for non mediasoup related message exchange (such as authentication procedures, chat messages, file transfer and whatever the application wishes to implement).
